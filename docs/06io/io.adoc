== Accessing more I/O
So far the examples have shown how to access the GPIO pins on the BeagleBone Black's 
`P9` header and through the `__R30` register.  Below shows how more GPIO pins
can be accessed.

The following are resources used in this chapter.

=== Editing /boot/uEnv.txt to access the P8 header on the Black
==== Problem
When I try ton configure some pins on the `P8` header of the Black I get an error.

.config-pin
[source,bash]
----
bone$ config-pin P8_28 pruout
P8_27 pinmux file not found!
Pin has no cape: P8_27
----
// TODO:  I made up the output.  Make sure it is correct.

==== Solution
On the images for the BeagleBone Black, the HDMI display driver is enabled by
default.  The driver uses many of the `P8` pins.  If you are not using
HDMI video (or the HDI audio, or even the eMMC) you can disable it by editing
`/boot/uEnt.txt`

Open `/boot/uEnv.txt` and scroll down aways until you see:
./boot/uEnv.txt
[source,bash]
----
###Disable auto loading of virtual capes (emmc/video/wireless/adc)
#disable_uboot_overlay_emmc=1
disable_uboot_overlay_video=1
#disable_uboot_overlay_audio=1
----
Uncomment the lines that correspond to the devices you want to disable and
free up their pins.  
[TIP]
====
https://github.com/derekmolloy/exploringBB/blob/master/chp06/docs/BeagleboneBlackP8HeaderTable.pdf[P8 Header Table]
shows what pins are allocated for what.
====
Save the file and reboot.  You now have access to the `P8` pins.

=== Accessing gpio

==== Problem
I've used up all the GPIO in `__R30`, where can I get more?

==== Solution
So far we have focused on using PRU 0.  
<<../05blocks/blocks.html#_pwm1_c,Table 3>> shows 
// TODO Put a tag on Table 3
that PRU 0 can access ten GPIO pins on the BeagleBone Black.  If you use
PRU 1 you can get to an additional 14 pins (if they aren't in use for other things.)

What if you need even more GPIO pins? You can access _any_ GPIO pin by going
through the **o**ne **c**hip **p**eripheral ()CP) port.

.PRU Integration

The figure above shows we've been using the _Enhanced GPIO_ interface when using
`__R30`, but it also shows you can use the OCP.  You get access to many more
GPIO pins, but it's a slower access.

.gpio1.c
[source,c,linenums]
----
include::code/gpio1.c[gpio1.c]
----
This code will toggle `P9_11` on and off. Here's the setup file.

.gpio_setup.sh
[source,bash,linenums]
----
include::code/gpio_setup.sh[gpio_setup.sh]
----
Notice in the code `config-pin` set `P9_11` to `gpio`, not `pruout`. This is because
are are using the OCP interface to the pin, not the usual PRU interface.

Set your exports and make.
[source,bash] 
----
bone$ export PRUN=0
bone$ export TARGET=pwm1
bone$ make
-    Stopping PRU 0
stop
-	copying firmware file /tmp/pru0-gen/gpio1.out to /lib/firmware/am335x-pru0-fw
-    Starting PRU 0
start
----

==== Discussion
When you run the code you see `P9_11` toggling on and off.  Let's go through
the code line-by-line to see what's happening.

.gpio1 line-by-line
|===
|Line|Explanation

|2-4 |Standard includes
|6-9 |The AM335x has four 32-bit GPIO ports.  These lines define the addresses
for each of the ports.  You can find these in Table 2-2 page 180 of the
https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/spruh73p/spruh73p.pdf[AM335x Technical Reference Manual].
Look up `P9_11` in the https://github.com/derekmolloy/exploringBB/blob/master/chp06/docs/BeagleboneBlackP9HeaderTable.pdf[P9 Header Table].
Under the _Mode7_ column you see `gpio0[30]`.  This means `P9_11` is bit 30
on GPIO port 0.  Therefore we will use `GPIO0` in this code.
|10   |Here we define the address offset from `GIO0` that will allow us to clear
any (or all) bits in GPIO port 0. Other architectures require you to read a port,
then change some bit, then write it out again, three steps.  Here we can do the same by writing to one location, just one step.
|11   |This is like above, but for setting bits.
|12   |Using this offset lets us just read the bits without changing them.
|13   |This shifts `0x1` to the 30^th^ bit position, which is the one corresponding
to `P9_11`.
|20   |Here we initialize `gpio0` to point to the start of GPIO port 0's control
registeres.
|23   |`gpio0[GPIO_SETDATAOUT/4]` refers to the `SETDATAOUT` register of port 0.
The `/4` is since `gpio0[]` expects a _word_ index and `GPIO_SETDATAOUT` is
a _byte_ index. Writing to this register turns on the bits where 1's are written,
but leaves alone the bits where 0's are.
|24   |Wait 100,000,000 cycles, which is 0.5 seconds.
|25   |This is like like line 23, but the output bit is set to 0 where 1's are written.

===== How fast can it go?
This approach to GPIO goes through the slower OCP interface.  If you set `__delay_cycls(0)` you can see how fast it is.

.gpio1.c with __delay_cycles(0)
image:figures/gpio0delay.png[gpio1.c with __delay_cycles(0)]

The period is 80ns which is 12.MHz.  That's about one forth the speed of the
`__R30` method, but still not bad.

If you are using an oscilloscope, look closely and you'll see the following.

.PWM with jitter
image:figures/jitter.png[PWM with jitter]

The PRU is still as solid as before in it's timing, but now it's going through
the OCP interface.  This interface is shared with other parts of the system,
therefore the sometimes the PRU must wait for the other parts to finish.  
When this happens the pulse width is a bit longer than usual thus adding
jitter to the output.

For many applications a few nanoseconds of jitter is unimportant and this
GPIO interface can be used.  If your application needs better timing,
use the `__R30` interface.
