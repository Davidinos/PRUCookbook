## Building Blocks - Applications

Here are some examples that use the basic PRU building blocks.

### PWM generator
One of the simplest things a PRU can to is generate a simple
**p**ulse **w**width **m**odulated signal.  Here we'll solve a series of
problems starting with a single channel PWM that has a fixed frequency and
duty cycle and ending with a multi channel PWM that the ARM can change
the frequency and duty cycle on the fly.
