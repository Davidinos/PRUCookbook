== Getting Started
We assume you have some experience with the Beagle and are here to learn about 
the PRU.  This chapter discusses what Beagles are out there, how to load the 
latest software image on your beagle, how to run the Cloud9 IDE and how to 
blink an LED.

=== Selecting a Beagle

==== Problem
Which Beagle should you use?

==== Solution
<http://beagleboard.org/boards> lists the many Beagles from which to choose.  
Here we'll 
give examples for the venerable http://beagleboard.org/black[BeagleBone Black], 
the robotics http://beagleboard.org/blue[BeagleBone Blue] and 
tiny http://beagleboard.org/pocket[PockeBeagle].  All the examples should also 
run on the other Beagles too.

==== Discussion
==== BeagleBone Black
If you aren't sure which Beagle to use, it's hard to go wrong with the
http://beagleboard.org/black[BeagleBone Black].  It's the most popular member of the open hardware Beagle family.

[[start_black]]

// TODO:  Remove magnifying glass.

The Black has:

* AM335x 1GHz ARMÂ® Cortex-A8 processor
* 512MB DDR3 RAM
* 4GB 8-bit eMMC on-board flash storage
* 3D graphics accelerator
* NEON floating-point accelerator
* 2x PRU 32-bit microcontrollers
* USB client for power & communications
* USB host
* Ethernet
* HDMI
* 2x 46 pin headers

See <http://beagleboard.org/black> for more details.

==== BeagleBone Blue

The http://beagleboard.org/blue[Blue] is a good choice if you are doing robotics.

[[start_blue]]
.BeagleBone Blue

The Blue has everyting the Black has except the Ethernet and HDMI.  It also has

* Wireless: 802.11bgn, Bluetooth 4.1 and BLE
* Battery support: 2-cell LiPo with balancing, LED state-of-charge monitor
* Charger input: 9-18V
* Motor control: 8 6V servo out, 4 bidirectional DC motor out, 4 quadrature encoder in
* Sensors: 9 axis IMU (accels, gyros, magnetometer), barometer, thermometer
* User interface: 11 user programmable LEDs, 2 user programmable buttons

In addition you can mount the Blue on the 
https://www.renaissancerobotics.com/eduMIP.html[EduMIP kit] as shown in
<<start_edumip>> to get a balancing robot.

shows how to assemble the robot and control it from 
http://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/labview.html[LabVIEW].

===== PocketBeagle
The http://beagleboard.org/pocket[PocketBeagle] is the newest member of the 
Beagle family.  It is an ultra-tiny-yet-complete Beagle that is software 
compatible with the other Beagles.

[[start_pocket]]

The Pocket is based on the same processor and the Black and Blue and has:

* 8 analog inputs
* 44 digital I/Os and 
* numerous digital interface peripherals

See <http://beagleboard.org/pocket> for more details.


=== Installing the Latest OS on Your Bone

==== Problem
You want to find the lastest version of Debian that is available for your Bone.

==== Solution
On your host computer open a browser and go to
http://rcn-ee.net/deb/testing/](http://rcn-ee.net/deb/testing/
This shows you a list of dates of the most recent Debian images.

.Latest Debian images
image:figures/debianImages1.png[Latest Debian images]

Scroll to the bottom of the list for that latest image as shown in
<<start_images>>.

[[start_images]]
.Latest Debian images bottom view
image:figures/debianImages2.png[Latest Debian images]

Click on the most recent one and you'll see many choices as shown in 
<<start_choices>>.

[[start_choices]]
.Debian Images from which to choose
image::figures/debianImages3.png[Debian image choice]

I suggest using the *stretch-iot* image.  *buster* is still a few months 
from release at the time of this writing and isn't ready yet.  
The other *stretech* images include 
x-window packages which we don't need.  The *stretch-console* is a minimal 
image which doesn't include things we do need.

Click on *stretch-iot* and you'll see <<start_strtech>>.

[[start_strtech]]
.stretch-iot choices
image::figures/debianImages4.png[stretch-iot choices]

Download *bone-debian-9.5-iot-armhf-2018-08-12-4gb.img.xz*.  It contains all the 
packages we'll need.

=== Cloud9 IDE
==== Problem
How do I manage and edit my files?

==== Solution

=== Blinking an LED
The 'hello, world' of the embedded world is to flash an LED. <<start_hello>> 
is some code that blinks the `USR3` LED five times.

Later chapters will go into details of how this code works.
