## Case Studies

The **P**rogrammable **R**eal-Time **U**nit (PRU) has two 32-bit cores which run
independently of the ARM processor that is running Linux.  Therefore they can
be programmed to respond quickly to inputs and produce very precisely timed 
outputs. A good way to learn how to use the PRUs is to study how others have 
used them.  Here we present some case studies that do just that.  

In these study you'll see a high-level view of using the PRUs.  In later
chapters you will see the details.

### MachineKit
MachineKit is a platform for machine control applications.  It can control 
machine tools, robots, or other automated devices. It can control servo 
motors, stepper motors, relays, and other devices related to machine tools.
