== Case Studies - Introduction

It's an excisting time to be making projects that use embedded processors.  
Make:'s https://makezine.com/comparison/boards/[Makers' Guide to Boards] shows
many of the options that are available and groups them into different types.  
_Single board computers_ (SBCs) generally run Linux on some sort of https://www.arm.com/[ARM]
processor.  Examples are the BeagleBoard and the Raspberry Pi.  Another type
is the _microcontroller_, of which the https://www.arduino.cc/[Arduion] is 
popular.  

The SBCs are used because they have an operating system to manage files, I/O, and schedule when things are run all while possibly talking to the Internet.  
Microcontrollers shine when things 
being interfaced require careful timing and can't afford to have an OS preempt an 
operation.

But what if you have a projcet that needs the flexibility of an OS and the timing 
of a microcontroller?  This is where the BeagleBoard excells since it has both 
an ARM procssor running Linux and two **P**rogrammable **R**eal-Time **U**nits (PRUs).

The PRUs have 32-bit cores which run
independently of the ARM processor, therefore they can
be programmed to respond quickly to inputs and produce very precisely timed 
outputs. 

There are many projects that use the PRU (<http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/PRU_Projects>) to do things that can't be 
done with just a SBC or just a microcontroller. Here we present some case studies that give a high-level view of using the PRUs.  In later
chapters you will see the details of how they work.

=== Robotics Control Library
Robotics is an embedded application that often requires both an SBC to control the 
high-level tasks (such as path planning, line following, communicating with the user)
_and_ a microcontroller to handle the low-level tasks (such as telling motors how fast
to turn, or how to balance in response to an IMU input).  The 
https://www.ucsdrobotics.org/edumip[EduMIP] 
https://www.hackster.io/edumip/edumip-13a29c[balancing robot] based on the BeagleBone
Blue demonstrates that by using the PRU, the Blue can handle both the high and low -level 
tasks without an additional microcontroller.

The http://strawsondesign.com/docs/roboticscape/[Robotics Control Library] is a 
package that is already installed on the Blue, Black and Pocket, 
that contains a C library and example/testing programs. It uses the PRU to extend the 
real-time hardware of the Bone by adding eight addional servor channels and one 
addition real-time encoder input.

The following examples show how easy it is to use the PRU for robotics.

==== Controlling Eight Servos
===== Problem
You need to control eight servos, but the Bone doesn't have enough PWMs
and you don't want to add hardware.  

===== Solution
The Robotics Control Library provides eight additional PWM channels via the PRU that can be used out of the box. 

[NOTE]
====
The I/O pins on the Beagles have a mutliplexer that lets you select what I/O 
appears on a given pin.  The Blue has the mux already configured to to run these
examples.  Follow the instructions in 
<<../03details/details.adocs#details_configure_servos, Configuring Pins for Controlling Servos>> 
to configure the pins for the Black and the Pocket.
====

Just run:
[source,bash]
[subs=+quotes]
----
bone$ *sudo rc_test_servos -f 10 -p 1.5*
----

The `-f 10` says to use a frequency of 10 Hz and the `-p 1.5` says to set the position to `1.5`.  The range of positions is
`-1.5` to `1.5`.   Run `rc_test_servos -h` to see all the options.

[source,bash]
[subs=+quotes]
----
bone$ *rc_test_servos -h*

 Options
 -c {channel}   Specify one channel from 1-8.
                Otherwise all channels will be driven equally
 -f {hz}        Specify pulse frequency, otherwise 50hz is used
 -p {position}  Drive servo to a position between -1.5 & 1.5
 -w {width_us}  Send pulse width in microseconds (us)
 -s {limit}     Sweep servo back/forth between +- limit
                Limit can be between 0 & 1.5
 -r {ch}        Use DSM radio channel {ch} to control servo
 -h             Print this help messege 

sample use to center servo channel 1:
   rc_test_servo -c 1 -p 0.0
----

===== Discussion
The BeagleBone Blue sends these eight outputs to it's servo channels.  The Black and the Pocket use the pins shown in the 
<<_register_to_pin_table,Register to pin table>>.

You can find these details in the 
https://github.com/derekmolloy/exploringBB/blob/master/chp06/docs/BeagleboneBlackP8HeaderTable.pdf[P8 Header Table], 
https://github.com/derekmolloy/exploringBB/blob/master/chp06/docs/BeagleboneBlackP9HeaderTable.pdf[P9 Header Table] and then https://github.com/beagleboard/pocketbeagle/wiki/System-Reference-Manual#673_PRUICSS_Pin_Access[Pocket Beagle System Reference Manual].

Be default the PRUs are already loaded with the code needed to run the
servos.  All you have to do is run the command.

//[/opt/source/Robotics_Cape_Installer/pru_firmware/src/pru1-servo.asm]

==== Controlling Individual Servos
===== Problem
`rc_test_servos` is nice, but I need to control the servos individually.

===== Solution
You can modify `rc_test_servos.c`.  You'll find it on the bone at
`/opt/source/Robotics_Cape_Installer/examples/src/rc_test_servos.c`, or online at
<https://github.com/StrawsonDesign/Robotics_Cape_Installer/blob/master/examples/src/rc_test_servos.c>.

Just past line 250 you'll find a `while` loop that has calls to `rc_servo_send_pulse_normalized(ch,servo_pos)` and
`rc_servo_send_pulse_us(ch, width_us)`.  The first call sets the pulse width relative to the pulse period; the other
sets the width to an absolute time.  Use whichever works for you.

==== Controlling More Than Eight Channels
===== Problem
I need more than eight PWM channels, or I need less jitter on the off time.

===== Solution
This is a more advanced problem and required reprograming the PRUs.  See 
<<../05blocks/blocks.html#_pwm_generator, PWM Generator>> for an example.
// ToDo, fill in XXXXX


==== Reading Hardware Encoders
===== Problem
I want to use four encoders to measure four motors, but I only see hardware for three.

===== Solution
The forth encoder can be implemented on the PRU. If you run `rc_test_encoders_eqep` on the Blue, you will see the output of 
encoders E1-E3 which are connected to the eEQP hardware.
[source,bash]

==== Reading PRU Encoder
===== Problem
I want to access the PRU encoder.

===== Solution
The forth encoder is implemented on the PRU and accessed with `sudo rc_test_encoders_pru`  
[NOTE]
====
This command
needs root permission, so the `sudo` is needed.

=== BeagleLogic - a 14-channel Logic Analyzer

==== Problem
I need a 100Msps, 14-channel logic analyzer

==== Solution
https://beaglelogic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[BeagleLogic] is a 100Msps, 
14-channel logic analyzer that runs on the Beagle. 

[verse,https://github.com/abhishek-kakkar/BeagleLogic/wiki]
____
BeagleLogic turns your BeagleBone [Black] into a 14-channel, 100Msps Logic Analyzer. Once loaded, it presents itself as a character device node */dev/beaglelogic*.

The core of the logic analyzer is the 'beaglelogic' kernel module that reserves memory for and drives the two Programmable Real-Time Units (PRU) via the remoteproc interface wherein the PRU directly writes logic samples to the System Memory (DDR RAM) at the configured sample rate one-shot or continuously without intervention from the ARM core.
____

The quickest solution is to get the https://github.com/abhishek-kakkar/BeagleLogic/wiki/BeagleLogic-%22no-setup-required%22-setup:-Introducing-System-Image![no-setup-required image].  It runs on an older image (15-Apr-2016) but should still work.

If you want to be running a newer image, there are instructions on the site for https://beaglelogic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html[installing BeagleLogic], but I had to do the additional steps in <<case_installing_beaglelogic>>.

Once the Bone has rebooted, browse to 192.168.7.2:4000 where you'll see
<<case_beaglelogic_capture>>.  Here you can easily select the sample
rate, number of samples, and which pins to sample. 
Then click *Begin Capture* to capture your data, at up to 100 MHz!

==== Discussion
BeagleLogic is a complete system that includes firmware for the PRUs, 
a kernel module and a web interface that create a powerful 100 MHz 
logic analyzer on the Bone with no additional hardware needed.

[TIP]
====
If you need buffered inputs, consider
http://standalone.beaglelogic.net/en/latest/[BeagleLogic Standalone],
a turnkey Logic Analyzer built on top of BeagleLogic and powered by the Octavo Systems’ OSD3358-SM SiP.
====

The kernel interface makes it easy to control the PRUs through the
command line.  For example

[subs=+quotes]
----
bone$ *dd if=/dev/beaglelogic of=mydump bs=1M count=1*
----
will capture a binary dump from the PRUs. The sample rate and number of 
bits per sample can be controlled through `/sys/`.

[subs=+quotes]

bone$ *ls*

bone$ *cat samplerate*

You can set the sample rate by simply writing to `samplerate`.
[subs=+quotes]
----
bone$ *echo 100000000 > samplerate*
----

https://beaglelogic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sysfs_attributes.html[sysfs attributes Reference]
has more details on configuring via sysfs.

If you run `dmesg -Hw` in another window you can see when a capture 
is started and stopped.

[subs=+quotes]
----
bone$ *dmesg -Hw*
[Jul25 08:46] misc beaglelogic: capture started with sample rate=100000000 Hz, sampleunit=1, triggerflags=0

----

BeagleLogic uses the two PRUs to sample at 100Msps.  Getting a PRU running at 200Hz to sample at 100Msps is a slick trick.
http://theembeddedkitchen.net/beaglelogic-building-a-logic-analyzer-with-the-prus-part-1/449[The Embedded Kitchen] has a nice article 
explaining how the PRUs get this type of performance.

any other type of 
https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2812.pdf[WS2812 LED]
and want to light it up.

==== Solution
You can either write your own code 
(See <<../05blocks/blocks.adoc#_ws2812_neopixel_driver, WS2812 Driver>>), or
use https://github.com/Yona-Appletree/LEDscape[LEDscape] which
is a library for controlling NeoPixels using http://openpixelcontrol.org/[Open 
Pixel Control].

[verse, https://github.com/Yona-Appletree/LEDscape]
____
LEDscape is a library and service for controlling individually addressable LEDs from a Beagle Bone Black or Beagle Bone Green using the onboard PRUs. It currently supports WS281x (WS2811, WS2812, WS2812b), WS2801 and initial support for DMX.

It can support up to 48 connected strings and can drive them with very little load on the main processor.

Background
LEDscape was originally written by Trammell Hudson (http://trmm.net/Category:LEDscape) for controlling WS2811-based LEDs. Since his original work, his version (https://github.com/osresearch/LEDscape) has been repurposed to drive a different type of LED panel (e.g. http://www.adafruit.com/products/420).

This version of the library was forked from his original WS2811 work. Various improvements have been made in the attempt to make an accessible and powerful LED driver based on the BBB. Many thanks to Trammell for his excellent work in scaffolding the BBB and PRUs for driving LEDs.
____

LEDscape can drive 48 strings of LEDs are arbitary length with no addional
hardware!  Here's how to install it.

[NOTE]
====
LEDscape uses UIO, an older method for talking to the PRU.  See
<<../06io/io.adoc#io_uio,Configuring for UIO Instead of RemoteProc>> to configure your Bone to use UIO.

LEDscape supports up to 48 channels (strings) of LEDs.  The above table shows 
how the channel numbers map to BeagleBone Black pins.  We'll use channel 0 
which maps to P9_22. Wire your LED string to P9_22.

You should now see "a pleasing pattern of rotating color hues".  

==== Discussion
LEDscape is higly configurable.  When you run `opc-server` it first prints out 
its configuration.  If it doesn't receive any data after three seconds it 
will go into demo mode.  In this configuration, `demoMode` is set to `fade` 
which produces the nice pattern you are seeing.  (You can set `demoMode` 
to `none` if you would rather not see anything.  See README.md for
other options.)

Notice it's currently configured to drive 48 strings (`usedStripCount`) with 
176 LEDS (`ledsPerStrip`). It's also set to interpolate (`enableInterpolation`) 
colors, that is, rather than abruptly switching to a new color, it will 
smoothly fade between the two.  With this configuration it uses about 26% 
of the ARM CPU.

Let's write a configuration file that fits our LEDs string. Copy the default
configuration and edit it.

[source,bash]
[subs=+quotes]
----
bone$ *cp configs/ws281x-config.json my-config.json*
----
Now edit it to match <<case_config>>.

[[case_config]]
.my-config.json
[source,bash]
[subs=+quotes]
----
include::code/my-config.json[]
----

Run this with:
[source,bash]
[subs=+quotes]
----
bone$ *sudo ./opc-server --config my-config.json*
----

Now we are only using about 7% of the ARM CPU.

You can now run a program that sends data to the string.  <<case_circle>> is 
a simple python example that sequencies an LED through the entire string.  It 
uses `opc.py` which is included in the `code` directory.

[[case_circle]]
.circle.py

=== RGB LED Matrix - No Integrated Drivers (Falcon Christmas)
==== Problem
You want to use a RGB LED Matrix display that doesn't have integrated
drivers such as the 
https://www.adafruit.com/product/2277[64x32 RGB LED Matrix] by Adafuit
shown in <<case_adfruit_matrix>>.

==== Solution
http://falconchristmas.com[Falcon Christmas] makes a software package
called 
http://falconchristmas.com/forum/index.php/board,8.0.html[Falcon Player] (FPP) which can drive such displays.

[verse, http://www.falconchristmas.com/wiki/FPP:FAQ#What_is_FPP.3F]
____
The Falcon Player (FPP) is a lightweight, optimized, feature-rich sequence player designed to run on low-cost SBC's (Single Board Computers). It was originally created to run on the $35 Raspberry Pi, hence the middle 'P' in the short name. FPP is a software solution that you download and install on hardware which can be purchased from numerous sources around the internet. FPP aims to be controller agnostic, it can talk E1.31, DMX, Pixelnet, and Renard to hardware from multiple hardware vendors, including controller hardware from Falcon Christmas available via COOPs or in the store on FalconChristmas.com.

The Beagle hardware can be either a BeagleBone Black with the 
https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/7mSHNZcD[Octoscroller Cape], or a 
pocketbeagle with the 
https://www.hackster.io/daniel-kulp/pocketscroller-led-panel-cape-for-pocketbeagle-fe12a6[PocketScroller LED Panel Cape]. 
https://www.diychristmas.org/wiki/index.php?title=Building_an_Octoscroller_Matrix_Display[Building and Octoscroller Matrix Display] 
gives details for using the BeagleBone Black. 

<<case_pocket>> shows how to attach the PocketBeagle to the P10 LED matrix 
and where to attach the 5V power.  If you are going to turn on all the LEDs 
to full white at the same time you will need at least a 4A supply.
